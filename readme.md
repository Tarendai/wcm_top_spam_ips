# Top Spam IPs

A WordPress plugin that collects the Top Spam IP addresses and lists them on a new admin
tools page. Allows to export them and to block via your `.htaccess` file.

## Contributions

This repo is widely open to _any_ sort of contribution.

Here's a list of things that need to get done:

 * A better readme file here
 * Translation into other languages
 * ✓ Screenshots both for the dot org txt file as well as for this file
 * ✓ Generate main translation files

### Ideas how this repo could move forward

This is just a rough draft and should be discussed in either a milestone or a (set) of ticket(s).

 * Automatically add all or just a single IP to the `.htaccess`
 * Remove a single IP (or all) from the `.htaccess`
 * Clean `.htaccess` on uninstall
 * Central storage for IP addresses, similar to project honeypot
 * Remote connection to send the IPs there

## Thank you!
